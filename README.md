A list of all configuration files for all my OS combinations!

Every folder contains a shell script that synchronizes the settings from this repo to your local machine. They just need permissions to run:

```shell
chmod +x dir/sync.sh
cd dir # It's important you cd to the specific `dir` to minimize failures
./sync.sh
```
