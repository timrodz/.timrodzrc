# .timrodzrc

A list of all configuration files for all my OS combinations!

Every folder contains a shell script that synchronizes the settings from this repo to your local machine. They just need permissions to run:

```shell
chmod +x dir/sync.sh
```

It's highly recommended to run all commands from the directory they're stored in.

```shell
cd dir
./sync.sh
```
