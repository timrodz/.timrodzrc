# .timrodzrc

A handy tool set for setting up my computers, featuring OSX + Ubuntu + Windows (WSL)

Every folder contains a shell script that synchronizes the settings from this repo to your local machine. If you need permissions to run them:

```shell
chmod +x dir/sync.sh
```

You need to run all commands from the directory they're stored in. Otherwise you'll get undesired results.

```shell
cd dir
./sync.sh
```

## Setup

This setup is clearly opinionated, but I chose these apps + configs because they're lightweight and work across all platforms.
